"Hello,

In this project, we went to the YouTube website and selected the desired song, obtaining its URL.
Then, we visited an MP3 converter site and added the obtained URL.
We selected the MP3 option from the dropdown menu and clicked "OK".
We chose not to close the opened advertisement pages in order to reduce the risk of errors;
instead, we navigated back to our initial site.
Next, we defined a wait method until the download button appeared during the conversion process.
Finally, we clicked the download button."
